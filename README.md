# Simon Game

An interactive Simon Game built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** as part of my journey to master full-stack development.

## About
The Simon Game is a classic memory challenge where players replicate a sequence of blinking colors. The game begins with one color flashing from four available options (red, blue, green, yellow). If the player clicks the correct color, the sequence grows by adding another color, requiring them to recall the entire order. A wrong selection ends the game, revealing the player's score based on the longest sequence matched. This project highlights my skills in front-end development, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and responsive design, as I explore the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).

## Features
- Dynamic gameplay with progressively longer color sequences
- Four color buttons with visual feedback (blinking effect)
- Score tracking displayed upon a wrong choice
- Responsive and user-friendly interface
- Clean, modular JavaScript code for game logic
- No sound effects (future enhancement planned)
